Navigate to
Godot\Python amd start:
1. background_finder.exe this will run with out stable diffusion AI image generator started in server mode, but you can use it in server mode if you like.

You may also run any of these as a python script


See below the outcome with no sound (the music is pretty bad)

I added a new program called  image_maker.py which allows you to create your own xml images easily, feel free to import this into your programs if you want uses to specify how their animated images are going to look.
